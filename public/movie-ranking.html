<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>The movie that changed cinema. It is the top movie for me till today.</p>
<h3>Green Mile</h3>
<p>I love that crime drama film as the book too. </p>
<h3>Saw</h3>
<p>It is not only a horror-thriller movie. If you watch it except the games of murder it can teach you something about life.</p>
